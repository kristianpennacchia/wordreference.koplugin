## Project overview

This is a WordReference plugin for KOReader. It provides a button in the highlight dialog that allows you to look up the selected text on [WordReference](https://wordreference.com/).

It is important to understand the inner-workings of KOReader as it is an open source project and not fully documented. However, there exists some documentation, as follows:

- Developer documentation: https://koreader.rocks/doc/
- Wiki: https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki
- User guide: https://koreader.rocks/user_guide/

Because the documentation is incomplete, you will likely need to reference the actual source code of KOReader to understand how it works.

## Guidance

If there is a file, class, widget, view, etc. mentioned in a message to the AI assistant, but you cannot find it in this project, you can try searching for it in the KOReader repository or in the documentation linked above.
