## Install

- Copy the `wordreference.koplugin` folder to your KOReader `plugins` directory on the device.
- Restart KOReader.

## Usage

1. Highlight a word or short phrase in a book.
2. Choose "WordReference".
3. A popup shows the definitions from WordReference.

- Shortcut:
  - Also available from the dictionary/wikipedia lookup popup (replaces the redundant 'Close' button).
  - Also available with a short-long press if enabling both the `Override Dictionary Quick Lookup` setting from this plugin and `Dictionary on single word selection` from KOReader.

## Settings

- Quick Lookup:
  - Open Menu → Tools 🛠️ → More tools → WordReference → Override Dictionary Quick Lookup.
  - This will override the dictionary quick lookup feature that is enabled with the KOReader setting `Dictionary on single word selection`. If this setting is disabled, then this override will do nothing.
- Language selection:
  - Open Menu → Tools 🛠️ → More tools → WordReference → Configure Languages.
  - Pick your desired translation (e.g., it→en, en→it, etc.).
- Shortcut:
  - Also available directly from the definition popup via the ⚙️ button on the top-left.
